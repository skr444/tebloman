== About

This document describes how to use the application.

== User interface

Each of the four entities managed by the application has a dedicated part of the main UI.

=== Profiles

A profile is a set of text fragments that make up a larger block of text.

.Profile editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_profiles]
image::tebloman_ui_profiles.png[image]

To create a new profile, click the *New* button and type a name into the textbox on the right.
Then click *Save*.
The stored profile will appear in the list on the left.

=== Placeholders

A placeholder (or placeholder tag) is a sequence of characters in a text fragment that is replaced by some value.

.Placeholders
[#img-tebloman_ui_placeholders]
image::tebloman_ui_placeholders.png[image]

To create a new placeholder, click the *Editor* button, which opens the placeholder editor window.

.Placeholder editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_placeholder_editor]
image::tebloman_ui_placeholder_editor.png[image]

Type a word into the *Pattern* textbox.
This sequence together with the start and end marker will be detected in text fragments and automatically replaced with another text.

Example::
You type the word `Me` and leave the default start and end markers.
You can now use the character sequence `{Me}` in text fragments.

There are two options for specifying a replacement text:

- Directly specify another text in the *Replacement* textbox.
- Bind a <<Replacement sources,replacement source>> to a placeholder by checking the *Has Source* checkbox and selecting from a previously created replacement source.

==== Date part identifiers

Through the use of date part identifiers it can be controlled how dates are displayed in fragments.
The application supports the following date part identifiers:

[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Identifier | Effect

| Date
| Displays the short date, e.g. `10.03.2025`

| Weekday
| Displays the name of the week day, e.g. `Tuesday`
|===

To use a date part identifier, simply type it after a colon `:` postfixed to a placeholder tag.

Example::
Say a placeholder named `ReturnDate` has been defined with an associated replacement source with a date.
This placeholder would be used in a text fragment as `{ReturnDate}`.
So, e.g., to specify that the week day is displayed, postfix `:Weekday`, which results in the placeholder tag in its entirety `{ReturnDate:Weekday}`.

==== Date format identifiers

Date format identifiers can be used in order to further specify the date format.
The following format identifiers are supported:

[cols="1a,5a,3"]
|===
| Identifier | Effect | Remark

| `Y` (or `y`)
| Displays the month and the year, e.g. `June 2025`
.4+.^| See {url-date-format-specifiers}

| `M` (or `m`)
| Displays the month and the day of the month, e.g. `June 15`

| `D`
| Displays the long date, e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2025`

| `d`
| Displays the short date, e.g. `15/06/2025`

| `I` (or `i`)
| Displays the date in the international format, e.g. `2025-06-15`
|
|===

These format identifiers can be specified by simply appending them to a placeholder tag after a colon `:`.

Example::
Going by the same example as for the <<Date part identifiers,date part identifiers>>, assuming the placeholder `ReturnDate` has been defined, adding the format identifier `D` would result in the full placeholder tag: `{ReturnDate:D}`

==== Locale identifiers

The <<Date format identifiers,date format identifiers>> are locale dependent, which is why the application supports defining locale identifiers to control the locale in which the formats should be rendered.

The locale identifiers can be specified similarly as the date format identifiers by appending them after a colon `:` to the date format identifier.

Example::
If the placeholder named `ReturnDate` should display the long date for the German (`de-DE`) locale, the full placeholder tag will be: `{ReturnDate:D:de-DE}`

The application supports all locale identifiers that can be represented by the {url-culture-types-enum}[CultureTypes] enum.
These identifiers are basically a combination of a two letter language code followed by a two letter country code separated by a hyphen `-` such as:

`<two-letter-language-code>-<two-letter-country-code>`

The two codes follow the ISO standards below:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| two-letter-language-code
| {url-iso-639-1}

| two-letter-country-code
| {url-iso-3166-1-alpha-2-codes}
|===

=== Fragments

A fragment is a section of text that can have an arbitrary number of placeholders.
Fragments are associated with a profile and are assembled into a larger text by the application.

.Fragment editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_fragments]
image::tebloman_ui_fragments.png[image]

Click the *New* button to create a new fragment.
Type a name into the small textbox below the *Add to profile* button and specify a text in the large textbox.
Use the previously created <<Placeholders,placeholders>>.
Click *Save* when finished and the created fragment appears in the *Available fragments* list.

Select a fragment in the *Available fragments* list and click the *Add to profile* button to associate it with the currently selected profile.
Use the */\* (up) and *\/* (down) buttons to move the fragment to the desired position.
Observe the assembled text in the *Output* textbox.

=== Replacement sources

A replacement source offers a convenient way to provide a replacement value for placeholders.
Replacement sources can either provide a date or a text that will be substituted for the associated placeholder tag.

.Replacement source editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_replacement_sources]
image::tebloman_ui_replacement_sources.png[image]

Click the *New* button to create a new replacement source and type a label into the *Name* textbox.
Either type a text into the textbox below or check the *Date* checkbox and select a date.
Then click *Save* and the created replacement source appears in the list.

See <<Placeholders>> for how to bind a replacement source to a placeholder.
