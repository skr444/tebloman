== About

This document describes how to use the application.

== User interface

Each of the four entities managed by the application has a dedicated part of the main UI.

=== Profiles

A profile is a set of text fragments that make up a larger block of text.

.Profile editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_profiles]
image::tebloman_ui_profiles.png[image]

To create a new profile, click the *New* button and type a name into the textbox on the right.
Then click *Save*.
The stored profile will appear in the list on the left.

=== Placeholders

A placeholder (or placeholder tag) is a sequence of characters in a text fragment that is replaced by some value.

.Placeholders
[#img-tebloman_ui_placeholders]
image::tebloman_ui_placeholders.png[image]

To create a new placeholder, click the *Editor* button, which opens the placeholder editor window.

.Placeholder editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_placeholder_editor]
image::tebloman_ui_placeholder_editor.png[image]

Type a word into the *Pattern* textbox.
This sequence together with the start and end marker will be detected in text fragments and automatically replaced with another text.

Example::
You type the word `Me` and leave the default start and end markers.
You can now use the character sequence `{Me}` in text fragments.

There are two options for specifying a replacement text:

- Directly specify another text in the *Replacement* textbox.
- Bind a <<Replacement sources,replacement source>> to a placeholder by checking the *Has Source* checkbox and selecting from a previously created replacement source.

==== Date part identifiers

Through the use of date part identifiers it can be controlled how dates are displayed in fragments.
The application supports the following date part identifiers:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Identifier | Effect

| Date
| Displays the short date, e.g. `10.03.2025`

| Time
| Displays the time, e.g. `08:15:00`

| Weekday
| Displays the name of the week day, e.g. `Tuesday`
|===

To use a date part identifier, simply type it after a colon `:` postfixed to a placeholder tag.

Example::
Say a placeholder named `ReturnDate` has been defined with an associated replacement source with a date.
This placeholder would be used in a text fragment as `{ReturnDate}`.
So, e.g., to specify that the week day is displayed, postfix `:Weekday`, which results in the placeholder tag in its entirety `{ReturnDate:Weekday}`.

=== Fragments

A fragment is a section of text that can have an arbitrary number of placeholders.
Fragments are associated with a profile and are assembled into a larger text by the application.

.Fragment editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_fragments]
image::tebloman_ui_fragments.png[image]

Click the *New* button to create a new fragment.
Type a name into the small textbox below the *Add to profile* button and specify a text in the large textbox.
Use the previously created <<Placeholders,placeholders>>.
Click *Save* when finished and the created fragment appears in the *Available fragments* list.

Select a fragment in the *Available fragments* list and click the *Add to profile* button to associate it with the currently selected profile.
Use the */\* (up) and *\/* (down) buttons to move the fragment to the desired position.
Observe the assembled text in the *Output* textbox.

=== Replacement sources

A replacement source offers a convenient way to provide a replacement value for placeholders.
Replacement sources can either provide a date or a text that will be substituted for the associated placeholder tag.

.Replacement source editor
[#img-tebloman_ui_replacement_sources]
image::tebloman_ui_replacement_sources.png[image]

Click the *New* button to create a new replacement source and type a label into the *Name* textbox.
Either type a text into the textbox below or check the *Date* checkbox and select a date.
Then click *Save* and the created replacement source appears in the list.

See section <<Placeholders>> for how to bind a replacement source to a placeholder.
